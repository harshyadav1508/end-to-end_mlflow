## MLFlow

MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It tackles four primary functions:

- **Mlflow Tracking:** Record and Compare different parameters and results(metric like accuracy, AUC,F1 score etc)
    
-  **Mlflow Projects:** Packaging ML code in a reusable form so that other data scientists can easily reuse the model, or so that you can run the training remotely
    
- **MLflow Models:** Managing and deploying models
    
- **MLflow Model Registry:** Providing a central store to manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model, including model versioning, stage transitions etc.

## Task
1. Train different models on our dataset and find best  model

2. Package training code (which gives best metric) in conda environment

3. Deploying the model
