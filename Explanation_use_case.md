## Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

- Customer churn, also known as customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.

- Churn is one of the biggest problems that most businesses are facing. It costs between 5 times and 25 times as much to find a new customer than to retain an existing one.

- We will try to build a model to predict customer churn with machine learning algorithms to understand what segment of your customers are most likely to leave 

- Dataset from Kaggle.com that included 7,033 unique customer records for a telecom company called Telco. Each entry had information about the customer, which included features such as: 

 * **Services** — which services the customer subscribed to (internet, phone, cable, etc.)
 * **Monthly bill total** 
 * **Tenure** — How long they had been a customer
 * **Basic demographic info** — whether they were elderly, had dependents, etc.

# Task 

1. Create a python notebook and train different models on our dataset

2. Compare different models & find best model with **MLFlow Tracker** function

2. Package python notebook with best model & upload it on Github (**MLFlow Project**) 

3. Run model remotely

4. Deploying the model  (**MLFlow Model**) 

5. Register one of the model(version 1) in Staging phase/stage with **MLFlow Model Registry**

5. Register another *model(version 2)* in Staging phase/stage & convert stage of the *model(V1)* from Staging to Production stage.
